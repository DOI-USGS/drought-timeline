Aside from the 1950s and Turn-of-the-Century Droughts, the Southeast has not experienced many severe droughts in recent history."

The region has now been in drought for over 20 years."

The last year of the Turn-of-the-Century Drought, 2016, was also a short, dry period for the Northwest."

Although the 1976-1977 drought also affected much of the region, the drought didn\'t last long. More recent drought events in the Midwest have been even shorter and less widespread."

The Turn-of-the-Century Drought did not affect a large area of the South Central U.S., but it did last a long time, with parts of the region in drought almost nonstop between 2000 and 2016."
